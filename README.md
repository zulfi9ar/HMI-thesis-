4-Make sure you have the latest Nextion and Proteus installed <br>
5-Make sure you have the arduino library installed in proteus<br>
6-create a virtual port using the virtual serial port software<br>
7-launch the nextion file "HMI.HMI"<br>
8-launch "Circuit.pdsprj" proteus file in "ProteusHMI"<br>
9-launch the Arduino ide file "HMI.ino" compile the code and copy the .hex address to the arduino in proteus<br>
10-in the nextion click debug and choose user MCU INPUT and choose a baudrate of 57600 and click start <br>
11-start the proteus simulation<br>
